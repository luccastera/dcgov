= DC Government GeoCoder and 311 API

... a ruby gem for the not-yet-complete API published by the DC OCTO

== Install

sudo gem install dcgov

== Example

Here's a quick example of how you could use it.

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'dcgov'
    results = DCGOV::GeoCoder.get({:address=>"441 4th str, nw"})
    print results.inspect

== Usage

Honestly, I haven't had a chance yet. But I will say this. If you go into the spec directory you'll find tests for the geocoder and open_311 APIs.

If you feel like helping out, expand this readme for me :-)
